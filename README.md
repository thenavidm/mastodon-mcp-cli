Mastodon MCP server and CLI for Claude Code, Codex and AI agents. 76 tools for posting, editing, threads, timelines, search, lists, notifications and following, across any instance.

One install gives you both surfaces, the same 76 tools under the same names,
reading one array of tool definitions so neither can drift from the other.

Setup is one command. Mastodon has no central developer portal, so this registers its own application on your instance and signs you in.

Instance limits are read from the instance, so character counts and poll options are correct wherever you are.

Built and maintained by [Navid Moazzez](https://navid.me?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mastodon-mcp-cli&utm_content=readme).

## Two ways to use it

### Command line

`mastodon-cli` in your terminal, for scripting, cron, pipes, or just asking a
quick question without opening anything:

```bash
mastodon-cli                                        # every command, one line each
mastodon-cli get-home-timeline --limit 50           # your home timeline
mastodon-cli get-account-statuses --acct alice@mastodon.social
mastodon-cli search --q "model context protocol"
mastodon-cli post-status --status "Shipped." --confirm
mastodon-cli list-accounts --json | jq -r '.accounts[].handle'
mastodon-cli <command> --help                       # what any command takes
```

`--confirm` is the shell spelling of the confirmation that posting, editing,
deleting, blocking and reporting require. `--json` gives JSON, `--compact` puts
it on one line, `--agent` is all of that plus no prompts and no colour, and
errors are JSON on stderr whichever you pick.

One caveat worth knowing before you script against it: **reading commands
return the tagged text**, so `--json` hands you that text as a JSON string
rather than fields you can filter. Writes and the account commands return real
objects, which is why the example above pipes `list-accounts` and not a
timeline. [Section 9](#9-reading-statuses) explains the format and why it is
shaped that way.

#### Exit codes

A script branches on the number instead of parsing the message:

| Code | Means |
|---|---|
| `0` | it worked |
| `1` | an unknown command |
| `2` | you typed it wrong, or a write was refused for want of `--confirm` |
| `3` | not found |
| `4` | the instance rejected the token |
| `5` | the instance failed |
| `7` | rate limited |
| `10` | nothing is configured yet: run `mastodon-mcp login <your-instance>` |

```bash
if ! mastodon-cli post-status --status "$MSG" --confirm; then
  case $? in
    10) echo "not set up yet" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    2)  echo "bad arguments, not retrying" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    *)  echo "failed, will retry" >&2 ;;
  esac
fi
```

### MCP server, for AI agents

`mastodon-mcp` is what Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor and the rest launch.
You never run it by hand:

```bash
npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli login mastodon.social   # or your own instance
claude mcp add mastodon -- npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli
```

Then just ask: _"what did my timeline argue about while I was asleep?"_

The `login` step stores the token, so the MCP entry needs no environment
variables. Every other client is in [section 2](#2-install).

### Which one

| Where you are | What you can reach |
|---|---|
| An agent that can run shell commands, like Claude Code or Cursor | Both. The CLI is the cheaper one: it costs nothing until you type it |
| claude.ai, the Claude Desktop chat tab, or a phone | The server only. There is no shell to run a command in |
| A terminal, a script, cron or CI | The CLI only. There is no MCP client in a shell |

They are the same program reading the same tool definitions, so anything one
can do, the other can.

## Features

Every tool is both a command and an MCP tool, with the same name. The command
is the tool name with dashes.

| Lists | `mastodon-cli get-lists` / `create-list` / `add-to-list` | `get_lists` / `create_list` / `add_to_list` |
| Direct messages | `mastodon-cli get-conversations` | `get_conversations` |
| Report an account or status | `mastodon-cli report` | `report` |
| Check your setup | `mastodon-cli doctor` | not a tool |

## 1. What you can ask it

- Post this, and put a content warning on it.
- There's a typo in Tuesday's post. Fix it without losing the boosts.
- What did my timeline talk about in the last 12 hours?
- Anything in my mentions that actually needs an answer?
- Find people posting about local-first software and tell me who's worth following.
- Follow the hashtags that keep showing up in my favourites.
- Read the replies to that post and tell me which ones are arguing in good faith.
- Make a list called "rust people" and put everyone I follow who posts about Rust on it.
- What's trending on my instance, as opposed to on mastodon.social?
- Turn these notes into a thread. My instance allows 11,000 characters, so check before you split it.

The second one is the point. Mastodon lets you edit a published post and keeps a public revision history, so the post keeps its boosts, replies and favourites. Deleting and reposting throws all of that away, so `edit_status` is almost always the right move.

## 2. Install

The long version, every step with what to do when one fails, is in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Node 20 or newer. Nothing else.

### Claude Code

```bash
npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli login mastodon.social   # or your own instance
claude mcp add mastodon -- npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli
```

The `login` step stores the token, so the MCP entry needs no environment variables.

### The command line

The same package installs both binaries, so the CLI needs no separate install:

```bash
npm i -g @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli
mastodon-cli --version
mastodon-cli                       # every command, one line each
```

Or run it without installing anything:

```bash
npx -y -p @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli mastodon-cli
```

`mastodon-mcp` is the server binary and `mastodon-cli` is the same tools as
shell commands. Both come from the one package.

### Claude Desktop

The quickest route is the extension: download the
[`.mcpb` from the latest release](https://github.com/thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli/releases/latest)
and double click it. It carries its own dependencies,
and asks for your instance URL and an access token in the install dialog. The
rest of this section is the manual route, if you would rather edit the config
yourself.

**1. Open the config file.**

In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings**, then **Developer**, then click **Edit Config**. That reveals `claude_desktop_config.json` in your file manager. Open it in any text editor.

If you would rather go straight there:

| Platform | Config file |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

On macOS you can open it from a terminal with:

```bash
open -e ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**2. Add the server.**

If the file is empty or does not exist, paste this whole thing in:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastodon": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have other servers, add only the `"mastodon": {{ ... }}` part inside your existing `"mcpServers"`, and put a comma after the entry before it. The file has to stay valid JSON. A single missing comma or a trailing one stops every server from loading, not just this one.

Run `npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli login <your-instance>` once before this, so the server has a session to use. [Section 3](#3-connect-your-account) covers it.

**3. Restart properly.**

Quit Claude Desktop completely and reopen it. On macOS closing the window is not enough, use **Cmd+Q**. On Windows quit it from the system tray. Claude only reads that file at startup.

**4. Check it worked.**

Look for the tools icon in the message box and click it. You should see `mastodon` with its tools listed. Then ask it something from [section 1](#1-what-you-can-ask-it).

If nothing appears, Claude Desktop's own log is the fastest way in:

| Platform | Log file |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mastodon.log` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-mastodon.log` |

```bash
tail -n 50 ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mastodon.log
```

Two things account for most failures. Node is not installed, or not on the PATH that Claude Desktop sees, in which case use the full path to `node` as the `command`. Or the JSON is malformed, which you can check by pasting the file into any JSON validator.

### Cursor

Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for every project, or `.cursor/mcp.json` inside a single project. Use the same JSON as Claude Desktop. Then reload the window, or open **Settings**, **MCP**, and toggle the server.

### Windsurf

`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, same JSON, then reload.

### VS Code

`.vscode/mcp.json` in a project, or run **MCP: Add Server** from the command palette.

### Everything else

Zed, Cline, Continue and anything else that speaks MCP over stdio all work. They each keep their config somewhere different, but they all want the same things: the `command`, the `args`, and the `env`.

### Docker

The store lives in `/data`, so mount a volume or pass the token directly:

```bash
docker build -t mastodon-mcp-cli .
docker run --rm -i \
  -e MASTODON_URL=https://mastodon.social \
  -e MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=… \
  mastodon-mcp-cli
```

### Self-hosting over HTTP

```bash
MASTODON_HTTP_PORT=8788 \
MASTODON_HTTP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
mastodon-mcp --http
```

Binds `127.0.0.1` by default. An access token reaches your whole account, so put it behind a reverse proxy with TLS before you change `MASTODON_HTTP_HOST`, and set `MASTODON_HTTP_TOKEN` so the endpoint is not open. `GET /health` returns the tool and account count without authentication.

### Check it worked

```bash
mastodon-mcp doctor
```

It checks the instance, the token, and **the token's scopes**, which is the failure people actually hit: a read-only token passes every other check and then fails on the first post with a 403 that never mentions scopes.

## 3. Connect your account

```bash
mastodon-mcp login mastodon.social
```

That is the whole setup. It opens your browser, you approve, and it stores the token.

### Have an agent do it

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent with terminal access:

```
Set up the Mastodon MCP server for me.

1. Ask me which instance my account is on, e.g. mastodon.social. Do not guess.
2. Run: npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli login <instance>
   It opens my browser and waits. Tell me to approve the request there, and
   wait for it to finish. It asks for read, write and follow; that is correct.
   If there is no browser available, re-run it with --oob and I will paste the
   code back to you.
3. Register the server with my MCP client. For Claude Code that is:
     claude mcp add mastodon -- npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli
   No environment variables: step 2 already stored the token.
4. Run: npx -y @thenavidm/mastodon-mcp-cli doctor
   Show me the output. Pay attention to the line about scopes: if it says the
   account cannot post, the token is read-only and step 2 needs redoing.
5. Tell me to restart the client. Do not post anything.

If I have more than one account, repeat step 2 per account and per instance.
```

It stops and waits at step 2, because only you can approve in the browser.

### Why this is one command and not five

Mastodon has no central developer portal. Every instance is its own OAuth provider, so before you can get a token you have to register an application **on that instance**. The usual instructions are "go to Preferences, Development, New application, tick these scopes, save, copy the access token", and people get it wrong in the same two places every time: they miss the `write` scope, or they copy the client secret instead of the access token.

`POST /api/v1/apps` is unauthenticated, precisely so that a client can register itself. So `login` does all of it:

1. registers `mastodon-mcp` as an application on your instance
2. opens `/oauth/authorize` in your browser, asking for `read write follow`
3. catches the redirect on `127.0.0.1`
4. exchanges the code for a token
5. verifies the token and works out your handle
6. writes it to `~/.mastodon-mcp/accounts.json`, mode 0600

`push` is deliberately not requested. Nothing here subscribes to push notifications, and asking for a permission you never use makes the token more dangerous than the tool.

### Check it worked

```bash
mastodon-mcp doctor
```

It reports your instance's real limits, verifies the token, and checks **the granted scopes**. That last one is the failure everything else hides: a read-only token passes every other check and then fails on the first post with a 403 that never mentions scopes.

### If you have no browser

```bash
mastodon-mcp login mastodon.social --oob
```

Prints the URL, you paste the code back.

### If you already made an app by hand

```bash
mastodon-mcp login mastodon.social --token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Or skip the store entirely:

```bash
export MASTODON_URL=https://mastodon.social
export MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=…
```

If you make the app yourself, tick **read**, **write** and **follow**, and copy **"Your access token"**, not the client secret.

### Revoking

`https://your-instance/oauth/authorized_applications`. Removing it there kills the token immediately. `mastodon-mcp logout <handle>` only forgets it locally.

## 4. Several accounts

Mastodon is federated, so an account is a **token plus an instance**. The same username on two servers is two different people. Running a personal account and a project account, often on different instances, is the normal case here rather than the exotic one.

Run `login` once per account:

```bash
mastodon-mcp login mastodon.social     # you@mastodon.social
mastodon-mcp login fosstodon.org       # project@fosstodon.org
```

Both are stored. `list_accounts` shows them:

```
you@mastodon.social      https://mastodon.social
project@fosstodon.org    https://fosstodon.org
```

Every tool that acts as someone takes an optional `account`:

```
post_status(status: "…", account: "project@fosstodon.org", confirm: true)
```

### How a name is matched

In order:

1. **Full handle**: `project@fosstodon.org`. Always unambiguous, always prefer this.
2. **Instance**: `fosstodon.org`, when only one account lives there.
3. **Bare username**: `project`, when only one account uses it.
4. **Prefix**, when exactly one account matches.

If two accounts could match, the call **fails and names both** rather than guessing. Two accounts called `alice` on two servers are two different people, and silently picking the first is how a post lands on the wrong one.

### Which account acts by default

The first one configured, unless you say otherwise:

```bash
export MASTODON_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=you@mastodon.social
```

### Or configure them without the store

```bash
export MASTODON_ACCOUNTS='[
  {"instance":"https://mastodon.social","access_token":"…","handle":"you@mastodon.social"},
  {"instance":"https://fosstodon.org","access_token":"…","handle":"project@fosstodon.org"}
]'
```

`handle` is optional; it is only used for matching, and `whoami` will tell you the real one.

## 5. What it costs to have connected

Both surfaces are the same program with the same 76 tools. The
difference is when the model pays for them. Measured in Claude Code:

| | MCP server | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Every message, with every tool loaded | 24,400 tokens | nothing |
| Every message, Claude Code's default | 1,700 tokens | nothing |
| When Mastodon comes up | nothing more, or the tools it picks | 3,600 tokens for `SKILL.md`, once |
| 20 messages with Mastodon in 1, every tool loaded | 487,000 tokens | 3,600 tokens |

Claude Code's [tool search](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search)
is on by default: it sends only the tool names and the server instructions,
and loads a tool's full definition when the model reaches for it. An app that
loads every tool up front pays the first line on every message, whether
Mastodon comes up or not. With the skill added, Claude Code also lists its
one-line description, about 140 tokens.

Where the tokens go, with every tool loaded:

| Part of the tool list | Share |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema structure: types, required lists, nesting | 59% |
| Argument descriptions | 29% |
| Tool descriptions | 12% |

To spend less, turn the server off when you are not using it, which in Claude
Code is the `/mcp` panel. `MASTODON_READ_ONLY=1` takes the 37 write tools off the list, leaving 39.
Or install the CLI and add the server on the days it earns its place.

Measured on 2026-09-27 with Claude Code 2.1.257 on Claude Opus 5: one
short prompt with and without the server connected, once with
`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false` and once with the default, the difference read
from the API's own usage figures. `SKILL.md` was measured the same way. Other
apps and models count tokens a little differently.

## 6. Tools

76 tools. Every one that acts as you takes an optional `account`; every listing takes `limit` and pages automatically past Mastodon's 40-per-request ceiling.

### Accounts and instance

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_accounts` | Every connected account and its instance |
| `whoami` | Authenticate and return the live profile |
| `get_instance_info` | Character limit, media and poll ceilings, version, server rules |
| `update_profile` | Display name, bio, the four metadata fields |

### Posting

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `post_status` | `status`, `media[]`, `in_reply_to_id`, `spoiler_text`, `visibility`, `sensitive`, `language`, `scheduled_at`, `poll_options[]`, `poll_expires_in`, `poll_multiple`, `confirm` |
| `post_thread` | `parts[]`, `media[]`, `in_reply_to_id`, `spoiler_text`, `visibility`, `language`, `confirm` |
| `edit_status` | `id`, `status`, `spoiler_text`, `sensitive`, `language`, `media_ids[]`, `confirm` |
| `get_status_source` | `id` |
| `get_status_history` | `id` |
| `delete_status` | `id`, `confirm` |
| `get_status` | `id` |
| `get_thread` | `id` |
| `list_scheduled_statuses` | none |
| `reschedule_status` | `id`, `scheduled_at` |
| `cancel_scheduled_status` | `id` |
| `get_favourites` / `get_bookmarks` | `limit` |

### Engaging

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `favourite_status` / `unfavourite_status` | `id` |
| `boost_status` / `unboost_status` | `id` |
| `bookmark_status` / `unbookmark_status` | `id` |
| `pin_status` / `unpin_status` | `id` |
| `mute_conversation` / `unmute_conversation` | `id` |
| `vote_poll` | `poll_id`, `choices[]`, `confirm` |
| `translate_status` | `id`, `lang` |
| `get_favourited_by` / `get_boosted_by` | `id`, `limit` |
| `report` | `account_id`, `status_ids[]`, `comment`, `category`, `rule_ids[]`, `forward`, `confirm` |

Every action has its inverse. Quoting is not here: Mastodon gained native quote posts in 4.5.0, but `post_status` does not take a quote, so to comment on something, post a status containing its URL.

### Timelines

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `get_home_timeline` | `limit`, `since_hours`, `max_id` |
| `get_local_timeline` | `limit`, `since_hours`, `max_id` |
| `get_federated_timeline` | `remote_only`, `only_media`, `limit`, `since_hours` |
| `get_hashtag_timeline` | `hashtag`, `local_only`, `any[]`, `all[]`, `none[]`, `limit` |
| `get_list_timeline` | `list_id`, `limit`, `since_hours` |
| `get_account_statuses` | `acct`, `exclude_replies`, `exclude_reblogs`, `only_media`, `tagged`, `pinned`, `limit`, `since_hours` |

`since_hours` reads a time window instead of a count: `since_hours: 12` pages until it reaches twelve hours back.

### Discovering

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `search` | `q`, `type`, `resolve`, `following_only`, `account_acct`, `limit` |
| `get_trends` | `kind` (tags, statuses, links), `limit` |
| `get_followed_hashtags` | `limit` |
| `follow_hashtag` / `unfollow_hashtag` | `hashtag` |
| `browse_directory` | `order`, `local_only`, `limit` |
| `get_suggested_follows` | `limit` |
| `get_conversations` | `limit` |

### The graph

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `get_account` | `acct`, the profile plus the relationship in one call |
| `get_followers` / `get_following` | `acct`, `limit` |
| `get_relationships` | `accts[]` |
| `follow_account` | `acct`, `notify`, `reblogs` |
| `unfollow_account` | `acct` |
| `mute_account` | `acct`, `duration` |
| `unmute_account` | `acct` |
| `block_account` | `acct`, `confirm` |
| `unblock_account` | `acct` |
| `block_domain` | `domain`, `confirm` |
| `unblock_domain` | `domain` |
| `get_mutes` / `get_blocks` / `get_endorsements` / `get_blocked_domains` | `limit` |
| `get_follow_requests` | `limit` |
| `answer_follow_request` | `acct`, `decision` |

### Notifications and lists

| Tool | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `get_notifications` | `types[]`, `exclude_types[]`, `limit`, `max_id`, `since_id` |
| `get_read_position` | none |
| `mark_read` | `notifications_id`, `home_id` |
| `dismiss_notification` | `id` |
| `clear_notifications` | `confirm` |
| `get_lists` / `create_list` / `delete_list` | `title`, `replies_policy`, `exclusive`, `id`, `confirm` |
| `get_list_members` / `add_to_list` / `remove_from_list` | `id`, `accts[]` |
| `get_announcements` | `include_read` |

`mark_read` uses Mastodon's read markers, which sync to the web app and every other client. `clear_notifications` deletes them permanently, which is not the same thing.

### Resources and prompts

Three resources: `mastodon://accounts`, `mastodon://concepts`, `mastodon://output-format`.

Three prompts: **catch-up**, **draft-thread**, **find-my-people**.

## 7. Writing safely

A status is public the instant it lands, and federation means deleting it does not pull it back off the instances that already have it.

So these refuse to run without `confirm: true`:

`post_status`, `post_thread`, `edit_status`, `delete_status`, `update_profile`, `vote_poll`, `report`, `block_account`, `block_domain`, `clear_notifications`, `delete_list`

`vote_poll` is on the list because a Mastodon vote cannot be changed or withdrawn. `report` is on it because it reaches human moderators.

Favourites, boosts, follows and mutes are **not** guarded. Each is one call to undo, and a confirmation on every favourite would only train the model to pass `confirm` reflexively.

### Turning writes off entirely

```bash
MASTODON_READ_ONLY=1        # 39 read tools, every write hidden from the list
MASTODON_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=0 # keeps favourites and follows, blocks posting and deleting
MASTODON_AUDIT_LOG=~/.mastodon-mcp/writes.jsonl
```

The audit log is one JSON line per attempted write, allowed and blocked alike, written mode 0600.

### Prompt injection

Everything from a timeline, a search, a notification or a conversation is text other people wrote, and on an open federated network literally anyone can put text in front of you. The server tells the model to treat all of it as data. Do not rely on that alone: `MASTODON_READ_ONLY=1` for an agent working through someone else's content is the real defence.

## 8. Writing statuses

### The character limit is not 500

It is whatever your instance says. Measured on 2026-08-31:

| Instance | Characters | Poll options |
|---|---:|---:|
| mastodon.social | 500 | 4 |
| fosstodon.org | 500 | 4 |
| infosec.exchange | **11,000** | **10** |

`get_instance_info` reports yours. This server reads it once per instance and checks against the real number, so a 2,000-character post is accepted where it is legal and refused with the actual limit where it is not.

Mastodon also does not count characters the way `String.length` does:

- **a URL always counts as 23**, however long it really is
- **the domain half of a remote mention is free**: `@alice@some.very.long.host` costs `@alice`

Both rules are implemented, so a link-heavy status is not refused for being over a limit it is not actually over.

### Media

- Up to whatever the instance allows, by public URL or `data:` URI.
- **Alt text is expected**, not optional. Mastodon's culture treats a missing description as rude and some instances flag it automatically.
- `focus` sets the visual centre as `x,y` between -1 and 1, which is what Mastodon crops thumbnails around. Without it, a portrait photo is routinely cropped to the subject's chest.
- Uploads are polled until the instance finishes processing. Attaching an id before it is ready fails with a 422 that does not explain itself.

### Content warnings

`spoiler_text` hides the body behind a warning. Used far more here than on other networks: politics, spoilers, food, health, and anything long. Not using one where the culture expects it is the most common way to be rude on Mastodon.

### Visibility

| Visibility | Who sees it |
|---|---|
| `public` | everyone, including the public timelines |
| `unlisted` | everyone, but not in the public timelines |
| `private` | your followers |
| `direct` | only the accounts mentioned |

A direct message is a status with `visibility: direct`, not a separate inbox. It is not encrypted, and admins on both instances can read it.

### Threads

`post_thread` takes an array and threads each part to the last. Every part is checked against the instance's limit **before anything is posted**, so a thread never half-publishes because part four was too long.

### Editing

Mastodon keeps a public revision history and the post keeps its boosts, replies and favourites, so `edit_status` is almost always better than delete-and-repost.

Call `get_status_source` first. The rendered content is HTML with links rewritten; editing that back would mangle every link in the post.

## 9. Reading statuses

Timelines, threads and search results come back as tagged text rather than raw API JSON. Measured on five real trending statuses from mastodon.social: 3,815 characters instead of 26,439, about 950 tokens instead of 6,600.

```xml
<statuses count="2" source="home timeline" next_max_id="…">
  <status id="1234" url="https://…" author="alice@example.social" author_name="Alice"
          posted_at="2026-08-31T09:14:02.000Z" visibility="public"
          content_warning="politics" you_favourited="true">
    <content>The text, with links restored to their real targets.</content>
    <media type="image" url="https://…" alt="…" />
    <engagement>12 favourites, 3 boosts, 1 replies</engagement>
  </status>

  <boost by="bob@other.social" at="2026-08-31T08:02:00.000Z">
    <status …>…</status>
  </boost>
</statuses>
```

- `posted_at` and `edited_at` are ISO-8601 UTC, so timestamps compare.
- A boost **wraps** the original rather than flattening it, so who said what is never ambiguous.
- `content_warning` is an attribute, so you can see a warning was set without the body being hidden from you.
- `<media>` carries `missing_alt="true"` when there is no description, worth flagging before boosting something.
- **Link targets come from the underlying `href`.** Mastodon deliberately truncates the visible text of a long link, so the displayed text is not followable. Stripping the HTML throws the real URL away.
- Mentions are rebuilt into full `@user@instance` handles. The raw markup carries only `@alice`, so a local alice and a remote alice are otherwise indistinguishable.
- `next_max_id` continues the listing.

## 10. What makes Mastodon different

Worth knowing before you point an agent at it.

**Federation.** There is no mastodon.com. Thousands of independently run instances talk to each other. Your instance decides your limits, what it can show you, and which servers it federates with.

**A post that "does not exist" may just not have arrived.** Your instance can only show you what it has federated in. Searching for the post's URL with `resolve` on makes it go and fetch it.

**Search is usually not full-text.** Most instances only index your own posts and ones you interacted with. A thin result set is the instance's policy, not a bad query.

**No algorithm.** Timelines are chronological. Discovery is hashtags, trends, lists and the directory. **Following a hashtag** puts every public post carrying it into your home timeline, and it is how most people build a feed.

**Boosts, and quotes this does not post.** Mastodon added native quote posts in 4.5.0 (`mastodon` API version 7); this server has not caught up, so `post_status` takes no quote. To comment on something, post a status containing its URL.

**Not everything is Mastodon.** Pleroma, Akkoma, GoToSocial and others speak the same API. `get_instance_info` reports the software, and `doctor` warns you when features like editing or trends may be missing.

## 11. How it works

```
src/
  index.ts              entry: stdio, --http, login, logout, doctor
  config.ts             credentials, and which account acts
  server.ts             tools, resources, prompts
  safety.ts             the write guard and MCP annotations
  doctor.ts             setup diagnosis, including OAuth scopes

  auth/
    login.ts            registers the app, runs OAuth, stores the token
    store.ts            ~/.mastodon-mcp/accounts.json, mode 0600

  api/
    client.ts           REST, Link-header pagination, retry, throttle
    errors.ts           one class per failure, each naming its fix
    instance.ts         per-instance limits, read once and cached

  content/
    html.ts             status HTML to markdown, links and mentions restored
    media.ts            upload by URL or data URI, with a processing poll
    text.ts             Mastodon's own character counting rules

  format/
    statuses.ts         the tagged output format

  tools/
    kit.ts index.ts accounts.ts statuses.ts engage.ts timelines.ts
    discover.ts graph.ts notifications.ts
```

Two dependencies: the MCP SDK and zod. No Mastodon client library: the API is plain REST and the parts that are actually hard, Link-header pagination and the HTML conversion, are not in the libraries anyway.

**Pagination.** Mastodon returns no cursor in the body. It returns a `Link:` header carrying `max_id`, and following it is the only way past 40 results. Every listing here does.

**Rate limits.** Mastodon sends real `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and an ISO `X-RateLimit-Reset`, which is more than most APIs give you. Retries wait for the actual reset rather than guessing.

## 12. Your data

Nothing is uploaded anywhere but your instance.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Access tokens | `~/.mastodon-mcp/accounts.json`, mode 0600, or your environment |
| OAuth client secret | Used once during `login`, never stored |
| Posts and reads | Between you and your instance |
| Audit log | Only the file you name in `MASTODON_AUDIT_LOG` |

No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only hosts contacted are the instances you configured, plus whatever URL you hand to `media[].url`.

## 13. Risks

- **An access token reaches your whole account.** It can post, delete, follow and block as you. Revoke it at `https://your-instance/oauth/authorized_applications`.
- **Posting is public and federated.** Deleting does not pull a status back off the instances that already have it.
- **Blocking severs follows permanently.** Unblocking does not restore them.
- **`block_domain` is very blunt.** It hides an entire instance and removes those followers.
- **Anything you read is untrusted text**, from an open network anyone can post to.
- **Your instance admin can read your direct messages.** So can the admin on the other end. They are not encrypted.
- **Rate limits are real.** A bulk unfollow of a thousand accounts will hit them.

If any of that is more than you want to hand an agent, `MASTODON_READ_ONLY=1` gives you 39 tools that cannot change anything.

## 14. Troubleshooting

**`mastodon-mcp doctor`** first. It names the failing step and the fix.

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Reads work, the first post 403s | The token has no `write` scope. `doctor` catches this. Re-run `login` |
| "rejected the access token" | Revoked, or it belongs to a different instance |
| "No account found for …" | Use the full `@user@instance` form |
| A post that exists returns 404 | Your instance has never federated it. `search` its URL with `resolve` on |
| Search returns almost nothing | Most instances do not full-text index public statuses |
| `translate_status` 404s | The instance has no translation backend configured |
| "Status is N characters" | Check `get_instance_info`; the limit is per instance |
| Media upload times out | Large video. The id stays valid; retry the post with `media_ids` |
| "will not run without confirm: true" | Working as intended. See [section 7](#7-writing-safely) |
| Edits, polls or trends missing | Not a Mastodon server. `get_instance_info` reports the software |

## 15. FAQ ❓

<details>
<summary><b>What is an MCP server?</b></summary>

An MCP server is a standard way to give an AI assistant real access to a tool,
so it can act rather than guess. You install it once, your assistant gains the
tools, and it works in Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT and anything else that speaks the
protocol. You never call the tools yourself, you ask in plain language.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is the CLI?</b></summary>

`mastodon-cli` is the same program as the MCP server, run as commands. AI agents that run commands, like Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode, use it on their own, and you can type the same commands in a terminal, a script or a cron job. Every tool is a command with dashes, so `get_home_timeline` runs as `mastodon-cli get-home-timeline`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Should I use the MCP server or the CLI?</b></summary>

Use the MCP server in an app with no terminal, like Claude Desktop's chat. Use the CLI anywhere commands run: an agent like Claude Code, Codex or OpenCode, a script or a cron job. The MCP server's tools take up context on every message, and the CLI costs nothing until it runs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is Mastodon?</b></summary>

Mastodon is social networking software that anyone can run. Each installation is
called an instance, it holds its own accounts and rules, and instances talk to
each other, so an account on one can follow an account on another. There is no
single company in the middle, which is why the setup below asks which instance
you are on.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to register a developer app?</b></summary>

You do not have to do it by hand. Mastodon has no central developer portal
because every instance is its own OAuth provider, so an app has to be registered
on your instance specifically. Registering is an unauthenticated call, so
`login` does the whole thing for you: it registers the application, opens your
browser, catches the redirect and stores the token.

Doing it manually is five steps in Settings then Development, and people get it
wrong in the same two places every time: they miss the write scope, or they
paste the client secret instead of the access token.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What permissions does it ask for?</b></summary>

It requests `read write follow`. Read covers timelines, search and
notifications, write covers posting and editing, and follow covers the social
graph. You can see and revoke the application at any time in your instance's
settings under Development.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is my data sent anywhere? Who can see it?</b></summary>

Nothing leaves your machine except calls to the instances you configured. There
is no backend here, no account to create and no telemetry. Your token sits in
your client's config and the audit log sits in your data directory.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it post without me asking?</b></summary>

It posts when you ask it to. Posting, threads, deleting, blocking and reporting
all require the model to pass `confirm: true`, which it sets after reading a
description explaining what cannot be undone.

Setting `MASTODON_READ_ONLY=1` removes every write tool from the list entirely,
so the model cannot see or call them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it delete something by accident?</b></summary>

Deleting needs `confirm: true`. Worth knowing that a delete does not reach the
copies already federated to other instances, so a post that travelled will
survive in places you cannot reach. Favourites, boosts and follows are not
guarded, because each is one click to undo.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work on any instance?</b></summary>

It works on any instance running the Mastodon API, and on the compatible
implementations that speak it. Limits differ per instance, so character counts,
poll options and media counts are read from the instance itself rather than
assumed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it cost anything?</b></summary>

It costs nothing. The server is MIT licensed and Mastodon's API is free. Your
instance may have its own rate limits, which the server respects.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work with ChatGPT and Cursor, or only Claude?</b></summary>

It works with any MCP client. Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS
Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI all run it the same way.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I connect more than one account?</b></summary>

You can connect as many as you like, including accounts on different instances
at the same time. Every tool takes an optional account argument, and a
preference order decides which is used when you leave it out.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I disconnect it?</b></summary>

Revoke the application in your instance's settings under Development, which cuts
access immediately, then remove the server from your client's config.
